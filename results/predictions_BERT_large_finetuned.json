regarding social advantages? [SEP] the free movement of workers regulation articles 1 to 7 set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers. first, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. in a famous case, the belgian football association v bosman, a belgian footballer named jean - marc bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from r. f. c. de liege to usl dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether dunkerque could afford to pay liege the habitual transfer fees. the court of justice held \" the transfer rules constitute [ d ] an obstacle to free movement \" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. in groener v minister for education the court of justice accepted that a requirement to speak gaelic to teach in a dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. by contrast in angonese v cassa di risparmio di bolzano spa a bank in bolzano, italy, was not allowed to require mr angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in bolzano. the court of justice, giving \" horizontal \" direct effect to tfeu article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \" impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means \", the measure was disproportionate. second, article 7 ( 2 ) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. in finanzamt koln altstadt v schumacker the court of justice held that it contravened tfeu art 45 to deny tax benefits ( e. g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions ) to a man who worked in germany, but was resident in belgium when other german residents got the benefits. by contrast in weigel v finanzlandesdirektion fur vorarlberg the court of justice rejected mr weigel's claim that a re - registration charge upon bringing his car to austria violated his right to free movement. although the tax was \" likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement \", because the charge applied equally to austrians, in absence of eu

relay provide connection - oriented operations. but x. 25 does it at the network layer of the osi model. frame relay does it at level two, the data link layer. another major difference between x. 25 and frame relay is that x. 25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. frame relay does not define any such handshakes. x. 25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. it only operates at the user - network - interface ( uni ). thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. x. 25 does specify some limited re - transmission procedures at the uni, and its link layer protocol ( lapb ) provides conventional hdlc - type link management procedures. frame relay is a modified version of isdn's layer two protocol, lapd and lapb. as such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end - to - end. any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. the x. 25 uni protocol is part of the x. 25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the osi model. it was widely used at the uni for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. some implementations used x. 25 within the network as well, but its connection - oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. frame relay operates principally at layer two of the osi model. however, its address field ( the data link connection id, or dlci ) can be used at the osi network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. thus, it rids itself of many x. 25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the dlci as an id beyond a node - to - node layer two link protocol. the simplicity of frame relay makes it faster and more efficient than x. 25. because frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like x. 25 it does not define internal network routing operations. for x. 25 its packet ids - - - the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. the same is true for frame relays dlci. how this is done is up to the network provider. frame relay, by virtue of having no network layer [SEP]", "57263b1638643c19005ad336": "[SEP]", "5a550e6f134fea001a0e187e": "", "5a550e6f134fea001a0e187f": "data link layer", "5a550e6f134fea001a0e1880": "before any

modes of action, and their indications. he devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in the canon of medicine. of great impact were also the works by al - maridini of baghdad and cairo, and ibn al - wafid ( 1008 \u2013 1074 ), both of which were printed in latin more than fifty times, appearing as de medicinis universalibus et particularibus by'mesue'the younger, and the medicamentis

[SEP] a study by the world institute for development economics research at united nations university reports that the richest 1 % of adults alone owned 40 % of global assets in the year 2000. the three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. the combined wealth of the \" 10 million dollar millionaires \" grew to nearly $ 41 trillion in 2008. a january 2014 report by oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50 % of the world's population, or about 3. 5 billion people. according to a los angeles times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1 % owns 46 % of the world's wealth ; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1 %, own about 0. 7 % of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. more recently, in january 2015, oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. an october 2014 study by credit suisse also claims that the top 1 % now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. in october 2015, credit suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each
